Question: In a recent case in New South Wales, SafeWork NSW prosecuted XYZ Constructions Pty Ltd and its manager, Jane Roe, after an incident where a worker was injured due to lack of fall protection measures during a construction project. The company was found guilty of failing to adhere to the guidelines set by the SafeWork NSW Code of Practice for Construction Work. Jane Roe was also found responsible for not providing adequate supervision and training to the workers. As a result, the court imposed a fine of $80,000 on XYZ Constructions Pty Ltd and a $25,000 fine on Jane Roe. The case served as a reminder of the obligations under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 to ensure a safe working environment and the importance of managerial oversight. What was the judgement regarding Jane Roe's role in the XYZ Constructions case?

cot:
To determine the correct option regarding Jane Roe's role in the XYZ Constructions case, we should analyze the information provided:

1. **Context of the Case**: The incident leading to the prosecution involved a worker being injured due to a lack of fall protection measures. XYZ Constructions Pty Ltd and its manager, Jane Roe, were prosecuted by SafeWork NSW.

2. **Findings**: The company was found guilty of failing to adhere to the SafeWork NSW Code of Practice for Construction Work. This indicates a clear breach of safety regulations that affected workers on the site.

3. **Jane Roe's Responsibility**: In addition to the company��s failings, Jane Roe was also held accountable for not providing adequate supervision and training to the workers. This suggests that she had a significant role in the company's safety practices and management.

4. **Judgment Details**: The court imposed fines on both the company ($80,000) and Jane Roe ($25,000). This indicates that while Jane Roe was found liable, her punishment suggests that she was not deemed fully responsible for the incident, as a lower fine compared to the company's indicates partial responsibility.

5. **Conclusion**: Since Jane Roe was found responsible without being entirely blamed for the incident (as evidenced by the fines), the most appropriate choice is that she was partly responsible.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is **She was partly responsible.**
