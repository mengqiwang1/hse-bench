To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the role and responsibilities of a temporary Acting Chief Inspector of Mines. The key aspects to consider include:

1. **Nature of Acting Positions**: An "acting" role typically implies that the individual is stepping into the position of another person who is unable to perform their duties. In such scenarios, the person is expected to carry out all the responsibilities and functions that come with that position, even if temporarily.

2. **Legal Framework**: Generally, when someone is appointed to act in a role within a government or regulatory structure, they inherit the full authority and responsibilities of that position unless specifically stated otherwise. This would include all entitlements associated with the office.

3. **Required Functions**: The Chief Inspector of Mines has significant responsibilities, including regulatory oversight and decision-making involving mine safety and operations, financial matters, and compliance. The acting inspector should be able to effectively handle these areas without restrictions, ensuring continuity of operations during the absence of the permanent chief.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (Only limited functions)**: This implies restrictions that would not typically apply to an acting position in such contexts.
   - **Option B (All functions and entitlements of the office)**: This is the most logical choice, suggesting that the acting inspector can perform all necessary duties associated with the role.
   - **Option C (Decision-making powers only)**: This would limit the scope of the acting position unnecessarily.
   - **Option D (Financial oversight only)**: This is overly restrictive and does not encompass the full range of responsibilities.

Given these considerations, the most accurate and comprehensive option is **B. All functions and entitlements of the office**. Thus, the Acting Chief Inspector of Mines would be entitled to perform the full range of duties required by the position.
