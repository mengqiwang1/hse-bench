To answer the question, we need to analyze the context surrounding the appointment of a temporary Acting Chief Inspector of Mines and the implications of their actions during their tenure.

1. **Understanding the Role**: An Acting Chief Inspector is typically appointed in a situation where the current Chief Inspector cannot fulfill their duties, such as due to prolonged illness. This appointment usually occurs under predefined protocols or regulations to ensure continuity in leadership.

2. **Authority of the Acting Inspector**: When an individual assumes the role of Acting Chief Inspector, they are generally granted the same powers and responsibilities as the incumbent, allowing them to make decisions and take actions necessary for the role despite the temporary nature of their position.

3. **Clarity of Need for Appointment**: The question raises the issue of whether the actions of the Acting Chief Inspector can be questioned, particularly if the necessity of their role was not previously clear. However, if an appointment was made due to a clear incapacity of the Chief Inspector to perform their duties, then the authority and actions taken by the Acting Chief Inspector should typically stand as legitimate.

4. **Precedent and Protocol**: In many institutional frameworks, temporary appointments are provided for in regulations or guidelines. These measures exist to address situations like the one given, thereby protecting the Acting Inspector's actions from being subjected to scrutiny simply due to the ambiguity of the circumstances at the time of their appointment.

5. **Evaluating the Options**: Given that the need for their role arises from a legitimate circumstance (the Chief Inspector's illness), the Acting Chief Inspector's actions should not typically be questioned. This aligns with the idea that their authority is recognized under the existing framework designed to manage temporary leadership gaps.

Thus, based on the analysis, the answer to whether the actions of the Acting Chief Inspector can be questioned, assuming their role was established following proper procedures despite any lack of clarity, would be:

**B. No, they cannot be questioned.**
