Question: A construction worker named John is required to work on a building site in a metropolitan area, specifically on the third floor, installing windows. He has received safety training but is not using a safety harness as there are temporary guardrails installed. However, he notices the guardrails are slightly loose. What potential issue arises from John not wearing a safety harness?
Option:
A. Improper training
B. Guardrails might fail
C. Lack of supervision
D. High wind speed
answer: B

To determine the correct answer to the question, we need to analyze the situation in which John finds himself while working on a construction site.

1. **Context**: John is working on the third floor of a building site, installing windows. Although he has received safety training, he is not using a safety harness because there are temporary guardrails in place.

2. **Safety Considerations**: Generally, safety harnesses are used as a precautionary measure to protect workers from falls, especially when working at heights. In this case, John has opted not to wear a safety harness, relying instead on the existing guardrails for safety.

3. **Condition of the Guardrails**: John notices that the guardrails are slightly loose. This observation is critical because loose guardrails indicate a potential for failure. Guardrails are designed to prevent falls, but if they are not secure, they may not effectively serve their purpose.

4. **Potential Consequence of Loose Guardrails**: If the guardrails fail due to being loose, John could fall from the third floor. The presence of loose guardrails creates an unsafe working environment, and not wearing a safety harness in this scenario increases John's risk of falling.

5. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - A. **Improper training**: This is not applicable because John has received safety training. The issue is not his training, but rather the situation with the guardrails.
   - B. **Guardrails might fail**: This is a valid concern given that John has observed the guardrails are loose. If they fail while he is working, he could be at significant risk of falling.
   - C. **Lack of supervision**: This option is not directly relevant to the immediate danger John faces from the guardrails.
   - D. **High wind speed**: While high wind can be a safety concern, it is not mentioned in the scenario, and the focus is on the loose guardrails.

6. **Conclusion**: Given the information provided, the option that best captures the essential risk John faces by not wearing a safety harness is related to the possibility of the guardrails failing. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. Guardrails might fail.
