Question: A construction worker named John is required to work on a building site in a metropolitan area, specifically on the third floor, installing windows. He has received safety training but is not using a safety harness as there are temporary guardrails installed. However, he notices the guardrails are slightly loose. What is the minimum force guardrails should be able to withstand according to OSHA?

cot:  
1. **Purpose of guardrail strength requirements**  
   Guardrails must resist forces that could dislodge them and expose workers to fall hazards. OSHA establishes a quantitative threshold to ensure reliability under normal use.

2. **OSHA specification review**  
   OSHA standard 29 CFR 1926.502(b)(3) mandates that top rails of guardrail systems withstand at least 200 pounds of force applied in any outward or downward direction.

3. **Eliminating other values**  
   Forces of 100 lb and 150 lb fall below the OSHA minimum, while 250 lb exceeds the required threshold but does not reflect the specified standard.

Therefore, the minimum force guardrails must withstand according to OSHA is 200 pounds.
