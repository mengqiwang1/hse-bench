"During a routine inspection at a mining site run by Company X, a significant incident involving employee safety was reported. John, an experienced worker, was assigned to clean an elevated platform over 2.5 meters high on Level 18. This task required the use of a hose, and the platform was supposed to be secured with guardrails. However, these guardrails were found to be severely corroded and structurally unsound. While performing his duties, John leaned against a compromised section of the railing, which gave way, causing him to fall and suffer severe injuries, including fractures to his arm and leg. The investigation uncovered that Company X was aware of the corrosion problem well in advance and had planned repairs that were never executed. It was also found that the company lacked a robust system for regular safety equipment inspections and failed to provide adequate training for such assessments. Despite having a safety management protocol, Company X neglected to address known risks, jeopardizing worker safety. The case centered on whether Company X violated health and safety obligations, leading to John's accident.

The mine is operated by SubsidiaryCorp, a fully-owned subsidiary of MiningCorp Ltd. Records reviewed during the audit indicated that while SubsidiaryCorp handles day-to-day operations, MiningCorp retains some overarching control, particularly in strategic decision-making. However, documentation related to safety protocols appeared to be inconsistent, with some records suggesting that MiningCorp might be involved in setting safety standards.

"During a scheduled audit of DeepSea Adventures Ltd., internal logs revealed that the company had modified its operational safety procedures during an underwater infrastructure project for BlueOcean Energy in federal waters off Western Australia. Specifically, a critical emergency vessel—designated for hyperbaric evacuation support—was redeployed during active dive operations without formal notification to the overseeing authority. The decision, reportedly made by the offshore supervisor in consultation with the vessel master, was justified as a logistical adjustment to expedite nearby maintenance tasks. Although daily safety briefings noted the vessel's absence, no formal risk reassessment was documented, and diver logs indicated no awareness of the change. The approved safety management system explicitly required that emergency evacuation support remain on standby throughout all dive activities.
