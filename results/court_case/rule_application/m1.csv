"In a mining operation overseen by Company X, an employee named John was assigned to clean an elevated walkway over 2.5 meters high on Level 18, as part of his regular duties. Although the walkway should have been secured with guardrails, they were found to be rusted and unstable.

Given these conflicting responsibilities, how should the safety rules have been enforced to prevent the accident?",By employing more workers,By ensuring proper safety inspections,By reducing working hours,By providing legal counsel on site,B,[2011] NSWIRComm 136
"During the dismantling phase of a construction project, an unsecured steel frame collapsed, causing serious injury to a worker. The subcontractor overseeing the site was tasked with enforcing safety protocols. Initially, the frame was properly secured, but due to a lapse in communication and incomplete adherence to safety measures, the hold-down nuts were prematurely removed, destabilizing the frame. The subsequent failure to re-evaluate the frame's stability prior to lifting operations led to the incident. This situation raises questions about the subcontractor's compliance with safety obligations. In what way did the subcontractor neglect its duty to ensure safety compliance?",By not providing safety equipment,By removing hold-down nuts before securing the frame,By not conducting tool box meetings,By hiring unqualified workers,B,[2012] NSWIRComm 46
"At a recycling facility in Wingfield, South Australia, John, an employee, was instructed to add sodium sulphide, a known hazardous substance, to a treatment tank using 25 kg bags.

"In a recent internal review concerning the operations of a coal mine in New South Wales, a safety inspector raised concerns about the degree of control exercised by MiningCorp Ltd over the site managed by its subsidiary, SubsidiaryCorp. The inspector noted that while MiningCorp had significant financial ties to SubsidiaryCorp, there were operational practices that suggested otherwise. For instance, the safety procedures in place at the mine could be modified by SubsidiaryCorp without requiring any prior approval from MiningCorp. Additionally, although MiningCorp's executives were observed visiting the site and receiving regular reports, these reports appeared to be primarily for meeting regulatory disclosure requirements rather than for direct management purposes. Given these circumstances, the court concluded that MiningCorp was not actively conducting business at the mine.
