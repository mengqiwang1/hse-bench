"At a mining site operated by Company X, an employee named John was assigned to clean a high walkway on Level 18, part of his regular duties. This walkway, elevated over 2.5 meters, was supposed to have secure guardrails. However, these rails were rusted and insufficiently maintained. While completing his task using a hose, John inadvertently pressed against a compromised section of the railing, causing it to give way.
